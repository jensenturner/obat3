OBAT 3 README
Installation:
Requires MySQL (dump provided) and NodeJS. Designed to be run under systemd on linux. 
Options in both main files - i2t.js, the interface/frontend, and d3t.js, the daemon/backend, pertain to the database
configuration and will need tweaking. They are located in one object near the top of the file.
Tested under Ubuntu Zesty and Trusty-on-Windows.
No NPM package.json is provided, but the node_modules folder is already populated.

Install all dependencies, then configure systemd or alternative to run
	/usr/bin/node /path/to/obat/d3t.js (auto restart; time before restart 17sec)
	/usr/bin/node /path/to/obat/i2t.js (auto restart)
in background. (sammple systemd .service files included)
The run-as user must have sufficient privileges to read and traverse files in the obat root directory.
Aside from tailing journald or comparable, daemon can be tested by watching the count
of the updates table. The web interface binds by default to port 8080 to allow it to be run
with a minimum of privileges.

The daemon obtains new data from OneBusAway and stores it in the database.
The interface exposes and organizes the data through a simple web site.

The majority of the functionality is in the two main files.
The other files are mostly supporting content and templates for the website.

Once the programs are up and running the best way to test is to mess around with query strings passed to the website.
Using the interface and watching closely should clue you in to how data is passed by GET requests.
